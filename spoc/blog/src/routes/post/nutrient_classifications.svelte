      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>
        My interpretation of the Book of Genesis is genetic. It talks about a firmament (mitochondria) and consumption of forbidden fruit (heterotrophy). Now here we are, non-autotrophic organisms, dependent on external systems for metabolic compounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given this dependency, we developed abstractions for metabolic intake. Thinking of edible compounds as nutrients is a useful abstraction, which allows us to make accurate predictions.
        However some of our abstractions are outdated. Each additional flaw limits the ability to predict outcomes, and prevents us from adapting to healthier choices. Let's update what we can.

      <h3>Protein</h3>
      <p>
        This might be the most broad description in nutrition. With over 100,000 unique proteins in the human body alone, tracking each type of protein wouldn't be practical. Tracking amino acid quantities is practical, and provides deeper metabolic insight.

      <h3>Sugar</h3>
      <p>
        In the past century, we have come to understand that sugars are a simple carbohydrate. Predictions gain more insight while considering it as such.

      <h3>Fats (lipids)</h3>
      <p>
        "Fats" can describe a nutrient type or stored tissue. I call "nutrient fats" lipids, and only consider adipose tissue as fat. So I typically avoid calling any nutrient a fat.
